# Godzilla-takes-353
For Projects and homework related to CPS 353 Fall 2917

I am Krista Christie, taking CPS 353 (internet programming) in the fall semester 2017.
This repository will be used for homework and work on the central project for the class.
I am a police officer at Gordon College taking computer science courses part time.
While I have done other coursework related projects in the past, the project for this class
  will represent my first ground up project that is not working on the bones of something already
  supplied by a professor.
I have a background in Biology with a Bachelor of Science degree conferred in 2004.
Prior to this course (post graduation) I have taken:
  Linear Algebra,
  Discrete Math,
  Intro to programming in Python,
  Object Oriented Software Development (Java),
  Software Systems,
  Data Structures and Algorithms (C++), and
  Database Systems  (Java and SQL)
